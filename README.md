# Measure_Cache_Size

This is my os project in NWPU.

This is a simple implementation of Dr Saavedra-Barrera's paper 

**CPU Performance Evaluation and Execution Time Prediction Using Narrow Spectrum Benchmarking**[http://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/1992/6137.html]

chapter5


## Problem Statement

Given a computer, how to characterize the parameters of cache and TLB as a user?

## My Implementation

'benchmark.sh' is to measure the cache size.

Having known the cache size, 'sbenchmark.sh' is to get the stride-time data in csv form.

## Code Details

Code is very simple, just read it.

## More Details

See report.pdf, which is my report slide in the class.
